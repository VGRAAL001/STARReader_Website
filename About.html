    <h2>About STAR Reader</h2>
    <p id="about-text">
        STAR aims to deliver a complete system that enables visually impaired learners to confidently write their matric examinations
        without assistance. The proposed system offers a transformative solution to the challenges faced by impaired students, especially during examinations.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more-text" style="display:none;">
        Leveraging advanced AI technology and additional platforms, the system provides real-time assistance in reading examination content using a tablet
        and audio device, eliminating the need for manual assistance from a reader. By utilizing the technologies put forward, selected exam questions are
        instantly vocalized to the students in a non-robotic voice, enabling them to navigate and engage with the content independently. Additionally, the
        multilingual support enhances the usability and inclusivity of the system where English and Afrikaans are at the forefront, ensuring a tailored
        examination experience for every student. Essentially, our system is a paradigm shift in the field of educational accessibility. We want to
        empower visually impaired students to overcome obstacles and establish a more equal and inclusive educational environment where all students,
        regardless of reading disability or difficulty, can reach their full academic potential. Overall, STAR Reader aims to streamline the examination process,
        promote accessibility, and empower visually impaired students to excel academically with confidence and independence.

            <h3>AI-Assisted Learning Tools</h3>
            <p>
                Using Azure AI Speech, our platform will be able to accurately scan assessment questions from digital papers thanks to its text-to-speech technology. Through seamless integration with tactile interfaces and screen readers, the system vocalises the questions instantaneously, making it possible for students with visual difficulties to access and comprehend with ease.

            <h3>Secure Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
               Maintaining the integrity and security of examinations is of utmost importance. Our system will use strict authentication procedures to protect the integrity of the assessment process and student data. This will prevent unauthorised access, maintain the credibility and fairness of the assessment process.

            <h3>Multilingual Support</h3>
            <p>
              Our system enables examination questions to be heard aloud with different languages and accents. This will enable students to engage with exam content with their preferred accent thereby improving comprehension and performance. The system will be able to read other languages so that students are able write all their assessments, including first and second additional language papers.

               We will collaborate with multiple schools to facilitate seamless adoption and implementation of the system and will provide comprehensive training and support to educators and assessment administrators. Through establishing collaborations with various stakeholders within the educational domain, we guarantee a smooth integration of our system with the current examination framework. This will enhance accessibility without causing any disturbance to established processes.

In South Africa, qualifying for reader assistance for examinations requires students to undergo an expensive process involving an educational psychologist and a written report justifying the need for a reader. For many South Africans, any form of disability or difference is viewed as a weakness, making it a privilege to even acknowledge difficulties with reading. Accessing an educational psychologist along with a reader is another layer of privilege, as is the availability of resources of a separate venue and qualified reader. This privilege is not accessible to all, evidenced by the fact that out of approximately 62,695 students who enrolled to write matric in the Western Cape in 2022, only about 2,256 applied for accommodations and concessions, which is a mere 3.6%.  We can raise awareness and reduce negative stigmas surrounding concessions, aspiring to make these concessions more accessible to all students. We aim to even the playing field for students who are disadvantaged by having a reading difficulty. We do not want to give these students an extra advantage.

As a team, we wanted to make sure that our UI is user friendly and so we took our target audience into account when designing our UI.
We used blues and greens, which is less likely to be confused by colour blind individuals as they are easily distinguishable from another.
We selected Verdana as our font as it has a high readability and helps users with visual impairments, making content more accessible.
